The dataset can be downloaded from the URL above.

Call the reference implementation as follows:

```bash	
clone this repository to the server
cd efficient-programs-WS2024
```

Everything is configured in the makefile. To make the reference implementation, run:

```bash
make VERSION=xy
```

To run the the test on small data, run:

```bash
make testsmall VERSION=xy
```

To run the the test on large data, run:

```bash
make testbig VERSION=xy

```

To run a sanity test with the reference implementation, run:

```bash
make sanity VERSION=xy
```

To get performance data, run:

```bash
make perf VERSION=xy
```

To create a new version, simply create a new folder within src with v{xy} and then execute the respective make command.

Furthermore, we created a shell script to fetch the data from our repo. This makes it easy to just develop on your pc, push it to Git and then execute the shell script (update_from_git.sh) to delete the current avaible version on the server and Æ’etch the current version from the repository. Just move the update_from_git.sh file to your home directory. Be careful, it contains an rm -rf for the efficient programs file, so everything that you would implement on the complang machine will be deleted.

Once:
```bash
cd efficient-programs-WS2024
mv update_from_git.sh ../
```

Then just simply:
```bash
/bin/bash update_from_git.sh
```


# History
# v1: Baseline Implementation
# v2: Reserving space for tables (TH)
Inserted: table1.reserve(20000000);
# v3: Implemented the parseLine function and optimized stream (TH)
instead of using istringstream we switched to manual line parsing
# v4: Loop Improvement (TH) - ignore
Improving the loop by reducing the number of find calls 
(I think this is Code motion out of loops)
# v5: Changing loop order (TH) - ignore
Changed the order of the most inner loops.
# v6: Loop Unrolling (TH)
Unrolling the loops in the join
# v7: (TH)
# v8: memory map (VB)
# v9: Buffered Output (SH)
Write everything at once in the end
